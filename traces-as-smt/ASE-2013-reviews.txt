* Yu: page 10, second column: 'sends are *match* to receives'

* Eric and Jay: Formalize the NP-reduction proof (table and prose are not
  sufficient)

* Yu: Fig. 7 looks strange. It is neither in logic nor in SMT syntax. I
  suggest the 'assert' keywords should be removed.

* Yu: why bother pruning "impossible" match pairs through the proposed
  algorithm? Even the crudest over-approximation should suffice to
  obtain the desired result. Please comment.

* Yu: If the end points change (e.g., with the value received before by
  the same task) or the sent data are dependent on the previously
  received data, the encoded constraints might be invalid. I have this
  concern because this point is not addressed in Section IV, and the
  example constraints in Fig.7 do not provide the sources of the data
  "a" and "b", which would require some level of static data flow
  analysis.

* Yu: It seems that "Elwakil's approach" is a very close work and it takes
  a similar idea with the main difference on how the match pairs are
  generated. If this is true, the paper would need to provide a strong
  evidence that generating the matching pairs is an important problem
  here, e.g., for soundness or efficiency. Section VI A does describe
  a comparison with "Elwakil's approach", i.e., "70% fewer clauses,
  uses half the memory, and eight times faster". However, such
  statements are not convincing without any details of the
  experimental data and the setup.

* Optional: The evaluated subjects are either toy programs or small benchmarks,
  and are not persuasive to demonstrate the practicality of the
  proposed approach.

* Optional: Move all the constraints for the encoding to one place in a table or
  figure rather than spread across multiple pages
