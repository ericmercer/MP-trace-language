* TODO Fix Fig 1 format
* TODO Clarify the point of this:
  "Please note that the encoding in this paper does not utilize the
  wait for sends as part of how it manages the different buffering
  semantics."
* TODO Clarify if this assumption is okay:
  "Further, this paper assumes that each receive operation has a
  nearest enclosing wait in the trace."
* TODO Clarify "that only when the sends target a common endpoint."
* TODO defref uses numbers that aren't displayed
* TODO Fix fig 5 format
* TODO Add sub-sections/paragraphs to section III
* TODO Remove every "Note" and "Recall" and "Also"
* TODO Table reference in V.B is bogus
* TODO Section 5.B lacks a "so what". 
  Perhaps the point should be that even given no information, it
  still finishes in 12 minutes
* TODO Section 5.C has a "Figure 6" alone
* TODO Table reference in V.C is bogus
