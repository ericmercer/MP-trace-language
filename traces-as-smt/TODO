* DONE Fix Fig 1 format
  CLOSED: [2013-05-09 Thu 13:51]
* TODO Clarify the point of this:
  "Please note that the encoding in this paper does not utilize the
  wait for sends as part of how it manages the different buffering
  semantics."
* TODO Clarify if this assumption is okay:
  "Further, this paper assumes that each receive operation has a
  nearest enclosing wait in the trace."
* TODO Clarify "that only when the sends target a common endpoint."
* DONE defref uses numbers that aren't displayed
