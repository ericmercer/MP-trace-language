\section{Conclusions}
We have presented an SMT encoding that uses match pairs rather than the state-based or order-based encoding in the prior work. Unlike the existing method of SMT encoding, our encoding can correctly capture the non-deterministic behavior of an MCAPI program. Also, we have provided an algorithm with $O(n^2)$ time complexity that over-approximates the true set of match pairs. Once the match pairs are generated by the algorithm, our solution with a \textit{CEGAR} loop is provided to prune infeasible match pairs from the initial set until we witness a true error or conclude no error is possible. Besides, the experimental results shows that our encoding can be solved efficiently compared with the existing work in \cite{elwakil:padtad10}.
