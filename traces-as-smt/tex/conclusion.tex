\section{Conclusions}
We have presented a trace language that can describe a CTP with a single trace on the same CTP. By executing a CTP with the language syntax, it can enter the final state that indicates whether the execution is correct or not. Also, we have defined a SMT problem that encodes the specific CTP, in which the match pair is defined to describe the transition of send and receive actions. Then we have proved the consistency of a trace language semantic and a SMT problem for a single trace given the same CTP. By expanding the set of match pair, we have proved that SMT problem can further imply more execution traces for a CTP. Thus, given a precise set of match pair, we can model all possible traces through a SMT problem. Finally, we provide a method of over-approximating the set of match pair that can lead to a refinement loop for finding errors.
