\section{Related Work}
Chao Wang et al. provided a symbolic algorithm that detects errors in all feasible permutations of statements in an execution trace \cite{wang:fse09}. They partition a concurrent program into a set of concurrent trace program (CTP), which we used in our work. Sharma et al. provided a verification tool, MCC, for verifying the MCAPI programs, but it was later discovered that this method does not completely explore the entire execution space of certain kinds of MCAPI programs \cite{sharma:fmcad09}. Elwakil et al. created a similar work with ours \cite{elwakil:atva10,elwakil:padtad10}. We compared two works in the previous section, where their encoding does not always model all feasible execution traces and it lacks the efficiency for solving the SMT problem.
