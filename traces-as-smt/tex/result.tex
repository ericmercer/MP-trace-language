\section{Results}
%In Section 4, we know that a well defined SMT problem can encode all possible execution traces for a CTP given a precise set of match pair. A precise set of match pair contains all possible match pairs that can exist in the real execution, and all match pairs that can not exist in the execution are not included. In other words, every hidden error can be found if it exists in some trace.
To evaluate the reliability and efficiency of our system, we compare to \cite{elwakil:padtad10} even though it misses valid MCAPI runtime behavior because it is the only other encoding for MCAPI programs and it suffices to illustrate the efficiency of our encoding.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
     & Program Order & Matches & Assume$\&$Assert & Extra Clauses\\
    \hline
    Our Encoding  & 11 & 4 & 2 & 0\\
    Encoding in \cite{elwakil:padtad10} & 22 & 13 & 3 & 8\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\label{table:program}
\end{table}

For the program in \figref{fig:mcapi}, we encodes 17 clauses for modeling the problem, omitting the definition of variables at the beginning of the encoding. Based on the encoding rules in \cite{elwakil:padtad10}, however, there are 47 clauses for the same program, omitting the definitions as well. \tableref{table:program} shows the number of clauses that constraint program order, match pairs, assume/asserts, and any other extra uncategorized clauses. Program order comprises the bulk of the encoding. The extra clauses in \cite{elwakil:padtad10} come from auxiliary variables in the encoding.

\begin{table}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
         & Example in \figref{fig:mcapi} & small1	 &	small2 & small3 \\ \hline
        Our Encoding& 17 & 8 & 4 & 11 \\
        Encoding in \cite{elwakil:padtad10}& 46 & 33 & 18 & 44\\ \hline	
		\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Comparison of two encodings for four different MCAPI programs with clause number.}
\label{table:comparison}
\end{table}

Other than the program in \figref{fig:mcapi}, we manually generate three programs and provide the experimental result in \tableref{table:comparison}. Small1 is a program with two tasks, where two sends are in the first task, and two receives are in the second task. Small2 is a program with only one task, where one send and one receive are in this task. Small3 is a program with three tasks, where three sends are in the first task, two receives are in the second task, and one receive is in the third task. The number of clauses follows the performance of the SMT solver with fewer clauses leading to better runtime. \tableref{table:comparison} shows that our encoding generates  1/5 -- 1/3  the clauses of that of the encoding in \cite{elwakil:padtad10}. We believe these reductions will generalize to any given program trace and match pair set.
